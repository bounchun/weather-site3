### 📌 Project Description

**Whether Weather** simulates a global weather information for multiple cities, including current conditions, seven-day forecast, alongside a dashboard overview, user preferences interface, and an additional wind chill calculator feature. 
All weather data used in this project is hardcoded. This multi-page weather forecasting website was built using **Eleventy (11ty)**, **Nunjucks**, **Bulma**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.
