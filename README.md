### 📌 Project Description

**Whether Weather** simulates a global weather information for multiple cities, including current conditions, seven-day forecast, alongside a dashboard overview, user preferences interface, and an additional wind chill calculator feature. 
All weather data used in this project is hardcoded. This multi-page weather forecasting website was built using **Eleventy (11ty)**, **Nunjucks**, **Bulma**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.

* Click a city card to open a **City Focus Page** with detailed weather information
* Use the **Settings Page** to select favourite cities and preferred weather conditions (UI only)
* Explore the **Wind Chill Calculator** to understand how wind speed affects perceived temperature
  
Navigation is available on every page using the main menu.

### 🔧 Configuration

City and weather data are stored in a global JSON file:
